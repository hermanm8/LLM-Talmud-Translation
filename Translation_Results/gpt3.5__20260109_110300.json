This is not difficult: here - in the first pairing, there - in the second pairing.",

          "From the Torah, from where do we derive that one witness is believed? For the Rabbis taught: \"And there is no witness in it,\" the Scripture speaks of two.",

          "From what is heard, as it is stated \"A single witness shall not rise up against a man,\" do I not know that he is one? What is the teaching to say \"one\"?

          "And the Merciful One said: \"Two are not in it, only one,\" \"And she was not caught\" - it is prohibited.",
          "Rather, the reason it is written, \"No single witness shall rise up against a man,\" is not as you might think, that I would say that a witness in the case of a Sotah is only one. And if there is not even one, then with what is she punished?",
          "It is necessary, as your mind has concluded, I say: \"A witness is not in it\" - he is not believed in it.",
          "There is no faithful in it?! Rather, what does it require —",
          "Until there are two? To silence a verse from it. For it is stated \"word\" \"word\" from money. And I know, since it is a matter of witnesses in the Torah!",
          "It is necessary, as your mind has raised: Sotah is different, for it is a matter of legs, as he was jealous of her and she concealed herself - there is no reliance on one witness.",
          "And who found saying that it is not reliable and permissible? But it is written, \"And she was not caught\" - implying that it is prohibited!",
          "It is necessary, as your mind has raised: \"He is not trustworthy in it\" - until there are two, and with two, it is as if \"she has not been caught,\" it is implied to us.",
          "Rabbi Yehoshua says: He acquires her through the mouth of two, etc. What is the reason for Rabbi Yehoshua's statement? The verse says, \"in her\" - in her and not through a euphemism, \"in her\" - and not through concealment.",
          "And Rabbi Eliezer says: \"Bah\" - and not by way of euphemism.",
          "And why not say: \"in it\" and not \"in concealment\"! Concealment is connected to impurity, as it is written: \"And it was hidden, and it became impure.\"",

The Sages responded: According to the words of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter.",

          "The sages responded: According to the words of Rabbi Yosei, the son of Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter. What is the reason? At times when one does not acquire and says \"zealous.\"",
          "Here is the translation of the Talmudic text: Talmudic text: Is there an end to our Mishnah? Sometimes it is not resolved, and he said, \"It is not resolved!\"",
          "Said Rav Yitzchak son of Yosef said Rabbi Yochanan: Even according to the words of Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter.",
          "Even according to the words of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and it is not necessary for our Mishnah? - Adrabah: There is a basis for our Mishnah, but there is no basis there!",
          "Rather, if it was stated thus - so it was stated. Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: According to the words of Rabbi Yosei, the son of Rabbi Yehuda, even in our Mishnah, there is no end to the matter.",
          "Rav Chanina from Sepphoris said: One should not say to his wife in our time, \"Do not seclude yourself with so-and-so,\" for perhaps he is like Rabbi Yosei, the son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said, \"Suspicion arises by itself.\" And she will be secluded, and there is no longer the water of the Sotah to clarify her status, and he will cause her to be perpetually forbidden.",
          "Reish Lakish said: What is the language of \"kinui\" - a matter that arouses jealousy between her and others. This implies that he holds that kinui is based on her own mouth, and the entire world does not know that he is jealous of her, and they say: What was in the beginning that separated, and then jealousy came upon her.",
          "And Rav Yeimar, son of Rabbi Shelamya from the name of Abaye, said: A matter that arouses jealousy between him and her. This implies that he holds that a declaration of jealousy is made based on the testimony of two witnesses, and everyone knows that he is jealous of her, and he is the one who comes to cause jealousy between them."

Tanah: even she'anshei Teverya v'anshei Tzipori shoklim bah. English translation: Avshalom was proud of his hair, as it is stated: \"And in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Avshalom for his beauty.\" And when he shaved his head at the end of every year, for it was heavy on him, he would weigh the hair of his head, and it amounted to two hundred shekels by the king's weight. It was taught: the stone that the men of Teverya and the men of Tzipori would weigh with.",
          "Therefore, he was hanged by his hair, as it is stated: \"And Absalom called before David's servants, and Absalom rode upon the mule, and the mule came under the thick branches of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and he was suspended between the heaven and the earth, and the mule that was under him passed by.\" Shikl Sapsera sought to resolve it. It was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: At that moment, the netherworld split open beneath him.",
          "The king was agitated and went up to the upper chamber of the gate and wept, and thus he said as he went, \"O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!\" And the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, \"O my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!\" Those Talmudic scholars say, \"Why 'my son' seven times? Because he was punished with seven punishments in Gehenna. And others say: he brought his head close to his body, and others say: he brought him to the world to come.",
          "\"And Avshalom took and set up for himself in his lifetime.\" What is meant by \"took\"? Reish Lakish said: that he took an evil acquisition for himself. \"The pillar that is in the King's Valley, etc.\" Rabbi Chanina bar Papa said: with deep counsel of the eternal King."
