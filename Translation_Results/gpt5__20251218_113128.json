          "And Rav Yeimar bar Rabbi Shelemyah in his name of Abaye said: a matter that casts jealousy between him and between her. Evidently he holds: kinui is by the mouth of two witnesses, and all the world know that he warned her, and he is the one that comes to make jealousy with her."

And the Chachamim say: The man is stoned naked, and the woman is not stoned naked!",
          "אָמַר רַבָּה: Rabba said: הָכָא טַעְמָא מַאי — here, what is the reason? שֶׁמָּא תֵּצֵא מִבֵּית דִּין זַכָּאִית, lest she go out from the Beit Din acquitted, וְיִתְגָּרוּ בָּהּ פִּרְחֵי כְהוּנָּה. and the Pirḥei Kehunna will provoke themselves with her. הָתָם — there — הָא מִסְתַּלְּקָא. behold, she departs. וְכִי תֵּימָא: and if you will say: אָתֵי לְאִיגָּרוֹיֵי בְּאַחְרָנְיָיתָא — he will come to provoke himself with another — הָאָמַר רָבָא: Rava said: גְּמִירִי דְּאֵין יֵצֶר הָרָע שׁוֹלֵט אֶלָּא בְּמַה שֶּׁעֵינָיו רוֹאוֹת. it is learned by tradition that the Yetzer HaRa rules only over that which his eyes see.",
          "אָמַר רָבָא: Rava said: דְּרַבִּי יְהוּדָה אַדְּרַבִּי יְהוּדָה קַשְׁיָא, that of Rabbi Yehuda against Rabbi Yehuda is difficult, דְּרַבָּנַן אַדְּרַבָּנַן לָא קַשְׁיָא? that of the Rabbanan against the Rabbanan is not difficult? אֶלָּא אָמַר רָבָא: Rather, Rava said: דְּרַבִּי יְהוּדָה אַדְּרַבִּי יְהוּדָה לָא קַשְׁיָא, that of Rabbi Yehuda against Rabbi Yehuda is not difficult, כִּדְשַׁנִּין. as we answered.",
          "דְּרַבָּנַן אַדְּרַבָּנַן נָמֵי לָא קַשְׁיָא. Of the Rabbanan against the Rabbanan also it is not difficult. הָכָא טַעְמָא מַאי? מִשּׁוּם ״וְנִוַּסְּרוּ כׇּל הַנָּשִׁים״. Here, the reason—what? Because of “and all the women shall be chastened.” הָתָם — אֵין לְךָ יִיסּוּר גָּדוֹל מִזֶּה. There— you have no chastisement greater than this.",

          "Shall we say that Rav Naḥman is a matter of Tanna’im? No, for everyone holds of Rav Naḥman. And here, in this, they disagree: one Master holds: his disgrace is preferable to him more than the pain of his body; and one Master holds: the pain of his body is preferable to him more than his disgrace.",
          "SHE WAS COVERED WITH WHITE GARMENTS, etc. It was taught: if black garments were becoming for her — they cover her with ugly garments.",
          "They were upon her vessels of gold, etc. Obvious; now, he is making her repulsive, these are needed? What is it that you would say: with these, she has more disgrace, as people say: a messenger naked and putting on shoes. It teaches us.",
          "“And afterward he brings a ḥevel, etc.” Rabbi Abba asked of Rav Huna: A ḥevel haMitzri, what is it that it should impede with regard to a sota? Is it משום that her garments not slip off from upon her, and with a small tziltzul also it is sufficient, or perhaps משום that the Master said: “She girded him with a tziltzul; therefore a kohen brings a ḥevel haMitzri and ties for her above her breasts” — does it impede?",
          "He said to him, you taught it: and afterward he brings a rope of the Miṣri and ties it to her above her breasts, in order that her garments not slip off from upon her.",
          "“And anyone who wants to see it may see, etc.” This itself is difficult. You said: “Anyone who wants to see it sees,” implying it makes no difference men and it makes no difference women; and then it teaches: “All the women are permitted to see it”: women—yes, men—no.",
          "אָמַר אַבָּיֵי: Translate it—people. אָמַר לֵיהּ רָבָא: But behold, “Anyone who wants to see in it, sees” it teaches!",
          "Rather, Rava said: Anyone who wants to see her, sees; it is no difference men and it is no difference women. And women are obligated to see her, as it is stated: “And all the women shall be chastened, and they shall not do according to your lewdness.”",
          "**Matni׳:** With the measure that a man measures — with it they measure to him. She adorned herself for a transgression — *ha-Makom* made her repulsive. She exposed herself for a transgression — *ha-Makom* exposed upon her. With the thigh she began in the transgression first and afterward the belly — therefore the thigh will be smitten first and afterward the belly, and the rest of all the body did not escape.",
          "GEMARA: Rav Yosef said: Even though the measure is nullified, in the measure it is not nullified.",
          "For Rav Yosef said, and so taught Rabbi Ḥiyya: From the day that the Beit HaMikdash was destroyed, even though the Sanhedrin was nullified — the four deaths were not nullified. But behold they were nullified?! Rather: the law of the four deaths was not nullified.",
          "One who has become liable to **seqilah** — either he falls from the roof, or a wild animal tramples him. One who has become liable to **sereifah** — either he falls into a fire, or a snake bites him. One who has become liable to **harigah** — either he is handed over to the **malkhut**, or **listin** come upon him. One who has become liable to **ḥanikah** — either he drowns in the river, or he dies of **seronkhi**.",
          "It was taught: Rabbi would say: From where is it that with the measure that a man measures with it they measure for him? As it is said: “With se’ah by sending her away You contend with her.”",
          "I have only *se’ah*; from where to include *tarkav* and half-*tarkav*, *kav* and half-*kav*, *rova* and half-*rova*, *tomen* and *ukhla*—from where? *Talmud* to say: “For every boot, booted with tumult.”",
          "And from where is it derived that every perutah and perutah joins to a great reckoning — the Talmud says: “one to one to find a reckoning.”",
          "And so we found with the Sotah, that with the measure that she measured — with it they measured for her: she stood at the entrance of her house to be seen by him — therefore a Kohen stands her at Shaʿar Nikanor and shows her disgrace to all. She spread for him fine sudarin upon her head — therefore a Kohen takes a kippah from upon her head and places it under her feet. She adorned for him her face — therefore"

          "Rabbi Shim‘on says: “And afterward he shall make her drink” — what does the Talmud say to teach by it? But is it not already said: “and he shall make her drink”! Rather, after all the acts, all of them, that are said above. It teaches: three things delay in it: until the kometz has not been brought near, and until the megillah has not been erased, and until she has not accepted upon herself an oath.",
          "Until the qometz has not been brought near. Rabbi Shim‘on is according to his reasoning, for he said: He brings near her minḥah, and afterward he gives her to drink.",
          "Until the Megillah was not erased. But rather, what does he give her to drink? Amar Rav Ashi: It was not needed except for that its impression is recognizable.",
          "Until she will not accept upon herself an oath. To drink it is that she does not drink; but a writing they write for her, and did not Rava say: A Megillat Sota that he wrote it before she will accept upon herself an oath — he did not do and not anything! In order that he will take her.",
          "With what are they disputing? Three verses are written: “and he shall give to drink” the first, “and afterward he shall give to drink,” “and he shall give her to drink” the last.",
          "Rabbanan savri: “and he shall give to drink” the first — for its own body, that he gives to drink and afterward thus he offers her minḥah. “and afterward he shall give to drink” — it is needed for him for that its mark is recognizable. “and he shall give her to drink” the latter — that if the megillah was erased and she says “I am not drinking,” they shake her and give her to drink her against her will.",
          "And Rabbi Shim‘on holds: “and afterward he shall make her drink” — for its own body, that he offers her minḥah and afterward makes her drink. “and he made her drink” the first — that if he made her drink and afterward offered her minḥah, it is valid. “and he made her drink” the latter — that if a megillah was erased and she said “I do not drink,” they compel her and make her drink against her will.",
          "And the Rabbanan — after the fact, the verse did not open.",
          "And does Rabbi Akiva hold: they give her to drink against her will? But is it not taught: Rabbi Yehuda says: an iron kalbos they cast into her mouth, that if the megilla was erased and she said “I do not drink” — they force her and they give her to drink against her will. Rabbi Akiva said: do we need anything except to examine her, and behold she is examined and standing! Rather: until the kometz has not come near — she is able to retract in her; from when the kometz has come near — she is not able to retract in her.",
          "וְלִיטַעְמָיךְ, תִּיקְשֵׁי לָךְ הִיא גּוּפַהּ: And according to your reasoning, it will be difficult for you—this itself: מִשֶּׁקָּרַב הַקּוֹמֶץ אֵינָהּ יְכוֹלָה לַחֲזוֹר בָּהּ? From when the *kometz* was brought near, is she not able to retract from it? וַהֲלֹא בְּדוּקָה וְעוֹמֶדֶת! But behold, it is examined and standing!",
          "It is not difficult: this one—where it returns in it on account of trembling, and this one—where it returns in it on account of health.",
          "And thus he is saying: All from reason of *beriyyuta* — entirely, entirely she does not drink. From reason of trembling, until that the *kometz* has not drawn near, for still the *megillah* has not been erased; or also, even if the *megillah* has been erased, for not properly the service of the *kohanim* they erase — she is able to go back in it. From when the *kometz* has drawn near, that properly the service of the *kohanim* they erase — she is not able to go back in it.",
          "A difficulty of Rabbi Akiva against Rabbi Akiva: there he said, erasing holds back, and here he said, kometz holds back!",
          "Two tannaim, and according to the view of Rabbi Akiva.",
          "They raised a dilemma for them: She said: I do not drink because of health, and she went back and said: I drink, what is it? Since she said: I do not drink — “I am impure” she is saying, and since she established herself in impurity, she is not able to go back on it. Or perhaps, since she said: I drink — it is revealed her mind that because of fear it is that she said. Teiku.",
          "אָמַר אֲבוּהּ דִּשְׁמוּאֵל: Abbuha d’Shmuel said: צָרִיךְ שֶׁיִּתֵּן מַר לְתוֹךְ הַמַּיִם. it is necessary that he put mar into the water. מַאי טַעְמָא — what is the reason? דְּאָמַר קְרָא: for the verse said: ״מֵי הַמָּרִים״, “the waters of bitterness,” שֶׁמָּרִים כְּבָר. that they are already bitter.",
          "**Matni׳**: Until that the *megillah* was not erased, she said: “I do not drink” — her *megillah* is stored away, and her *minchah* is scattered upon the ashes, and her *megillah* is not valid to give drink with it to another *sotah*. The *megillah* was erased and she said: “Impure am I” — the waters are poured out, and her *minchah* is scattered upon the *Beit HaDeshen*. The *megillah* was erased and she said: “I do not drink” — they undermine her, and they give her drink against her will.",
          "She does not suffice to drink until her face becomes greenish, and her eyes protrude, and she becomes filled with veins. And they say: Take her out, take her out, so that she not defile the Azarah.",
          "If there is for her merit — it suspends for her. There is merit that suspends one year, there is merit that suspends two years, there is merit that suspends three years. From here says Ben Azzai: A man is obligated to teach his daughter Torah, for if she will drink she will know that the merit suspends for her. Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who teaches his daughter Torah — (as if) he teaches her tiflut.",
          "Rabbi Yehoshu’a says: A woman wants a kav and tiflut, more than nine kavvin and perishut. He would say: a ḥasid shoteh, and a rasha arum, and an ishah perushah, and makkot perushin — behold these are mevallei olam.",
          "Gemara: Rav Yehudah said, Shmuel said, in the name of Rabbi Meir: When I was learning Torah with Rabbi Akiva, I would cast kankantum into the ink, and he did not say to me a thing. When I came with Rabbi Yishmael, he said to me: My son, what is your craft? I said to him: I am a lavlar. He said to me: My son, be careful, for your craft is the craft of Heaven, lest you diminish one letter or add one letter, you are found destroying the entire world.",
          "I said to him: One thing I have that I cast into the ink, and *kankantum* is its name. He said to me: But do they cast *kankantum* into the ink? The Torah said: “and he shall blot out,” writing that is able to be blotted out!",
          "What did he say to him, and what did he return to him?",
          "Thus he said to him: It is not necessary to say with respect to ḥaseirot and yeteirot, that I am expert; but even to be concerned for a zevuv, that perhaps it comes and sits upon the tag of the dalet and erases it and makes it a reish — one matter I have that I cast into the ink, and kankantom is its name.",
          "Is that so? But behold it is taught: Rabbi Meir said: When I was learning Torah with Rabbi Yishmael, I would put kankantum into the ink, and he did not say anything to me. When I came to Rabbi Akiva, he forbade it to me!",
          "Difficult: *shimush* upon *shimush*. Difficult: its prohibition upon its prohibition!",
          "Granted, *shimmush* after *shimmush* is not difficult: from the outset he came before Rabbi Akiva. Since he was not able (he arose) to arise according to his mind, he came before Rabbi Yishma’el, and learned *gemara*. He then returned and came before Rabbi Akiva; he reasoned a reasoning.",
          "Rather, its prohibition upon its prohibition is difficult! Difficult.",

          "And Rabbi Aḥai bar Yo’ashiya—he does not have: he wrote to divorce his wife and reconsidered; he found a man of his city and he said to him: My name is like your name, and the name of my wife is like the name of your wife—invalid to divorce with it?",
          "They say: There, “and he shall write for her,” the Merciful One said; we require writing for her sake. Here too, “and he shall do for her”! What is doing?—erasing.",
          "She is not sufficient to drink until her face etc.. Who is it? — It is Rabbi Shim‘on, for he said: He offers her minḥah and afterward he gives her to drink. For as long as her minḥah has not been offered — the water does not examine her, as it is written: “a minḥat zikkaron, reminding of iniquity,”",
          "Say the latter clause: “She has merit; her merit would suspend for her,” we have come to the Rabbanan; for if it is Rabbi Shim‘on, הרי he said: “Merit does not suspend in the bitter waters!”",

          "AND THEY SAY: TAKE HER OUT, etc. What is the reason? — For perhaps she died. Is it to say that a dead person is forbidden in the Camp of Leviyyah?",
          "And was it not taught: A *tamei met* is permitted to enter the *Machaneh Leviyah*. And they said not a *tamei met* alone, but even the dead himself, as it is stated: “And Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him,” with him—in his partition!",

Rabbi Elazar ben Yitzḥak, man of Kefar Darom, says: Nine months, as it is stated: “And she shall be cleared and shall conceive seed,” and there, it says: “Seed shall serve Him; it shall be recounted,” seed that is fit to be recounted.",
          "Rabbi Yishma’el says: Twelve months. And even though there is no proof for the matter— a remembrance for the matter, as it is written: “Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and redeem your sins with righteousness, and your iniquities with showing mercy to the poor.”",

          "Merit of a mitzvah—does it protect all this? But is it not taught: This did Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei expound: “For a mitzvah is a lamp and Torah is light”; the verse linked the mitzvah to a lamp, and the Torah to light. The mitzvah to a lamp, to say to you: just as a lamp does not protect except for the time being—so too a mitzvah does not protect except for the time being.",
          "and the Torah in light, to say to you: just as light protects the world, so too Torah protects the world. and it says: “When you walk, it shall lead you, etc.” “When you walk, it shall lead you” — this is this world. “When you lie down, it shall watch over you” — this is death. “and when you awake, it shall speak with you” — for the future to come.",

Once the pillar of dawn rose — he was saved from a wild beast and from the *listin*, and still he does not know on which way he is walking. He reached a crossroads — he was saved from all of them.",
          "Another matter: a transgression extinguishes a mitzvah, but a transgression does not extinguish Torah, as it is said: “Many waters cannot extinguish the love.”",
          "אָמַר Rav Yosef: A mitzvah, at the time that he is engaged in it — it protects and it saves; at the time that he is not engaged in it — it protects, it protects; it saves — it does not save.

          "Rabba challenges her: But from now, Doeg and Achitophel, did they not engage in Torah? Why did it not protect them? Rather, Rava said: Torah, at the time that he is engaged in it — it protects and it saves; at the time that he is not engaged in it — it protects from suffering, it does not save. A mitzva, whether at the time that he is engaged in it whether at the time that he is not engaged in it — it protects from suffering, it does not save.",
          "Ravina said: Always, the merit of Torah; and that which you say, she is not commanded and does—granted that with respect to commandments she is not commanded, in the reward of that they make their sons read and learn, and they wait for their husbands until they come from the house of study, do they not share with them?",
          "What is *parashat derakhim*? Rav Ḥisda said: This is a *talmid ḥakham* and the day of death. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: This is a *talmid ḥakham* and fear of sin. Mar Zutra said: This is a *talmid ḥakham* for whom the *shema‘ta* ascends for him according to the heart of the halakha.",
          "Another matter: a transgression extinguishes a mitzvah, but a transgression does not extinguish Torah.

In the end, he said to him: Come, let us join together and divide! A bat kol went out and said: “If a man would give all the wealth of his house, etc.”."
