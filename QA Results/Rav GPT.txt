What is the first step of the Sotah process?
It brings a series of sources, 
including the source in Numbers
Numbers5:11יהוה spoke to Moses, saying:
5:12Speak to the Israelite people and say to them: Any party whose wife has gone astray and broken faith with him,
5:13in that another man has had carnal relations with her unbeknown to her husband, and she keeps secret the fact that she has defiled herself without being forced, and there is no witness against her,

6:1:1Introduction Chapter six returns to discuss the process which needs to occur for a woman to become a sotah, the same topic with which the tractate began. In the first mishnah of the tractate we learned that the husband must first warn her not to be secluded with a certain man, and then she must be secluded with that man. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate whether witnesses are needed to testify that she was secluded with that man in order for her to become a sotah. According to Rabbi Eliezer, witnesses are not necessary. However, in the absence of witnesses the husband himself must see that she was secluded. According to Rabbi Joshua, two witnesses are necessary. In our mishnah, these same two tannaim debate whether or not the woman is prohibited to her husband if there is just a rumor that she was secluded. Although without at least some witnessing she cannot become a sotah, such that she drinks the water, a rumor might, under certain circumstances, be sufficient to cause her to be prohibited to her husband.
Who is subject to the Sotah process?
Sifrei Zuta - multiple sources that do answer this question, e.g. 
5:29:2"When a woman goes astray under her husband" — What does the Torah mean by "woman"? The term "woman" is repeated throughout this section to include various categories of women. This encompasses a widow married to a High Priest, a divorced woman or a woman who underwent the levirate marriage procedure (chalitzah) married to an ordinary priest, a mamzeret (a woman born from certain forbidden relationships) and a Nethinah (a member of a group assigned to perform menial tasks in the Temple) married to an Israelite, an Israelite woman married to a mamzer, Nethin, Ammonite, Moabite, Egyptian, or Edomite, a man with crushed or severed genitals married to a convert, and a profaned priestess (daughter of a priest and a woman forbidden to him). This includes all women who are disqualified but still undergo the Sotah procedure. Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, says that disqualified women are not subjected to the Sotah procedure.
How many witnesses are required before the Sotah process can be done?
It brings sources on witnesses from Deuteronomy 
Deuteronomy
17:5you shall take the man or the woman who did that wicked thing out to the public place, and you shall stone that man or woman to death.—
17:6A person shall be put to death only on the testimony of two or more witnesses; no one shall be put to death on the testimony of a single witness.—

Please tell me all the details of the Sotah process, starting from her husband bringing her to the Temple. What do the priests do?
Brings multiple sources from numbers
Numbers

5:15that party shall bring his wife to the priest. And he shall bring as an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley flour. No oil shall be poured upon it and no frankincense shall be laid on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of remembrance which recalls wrongdoing.
5:16The priest shall bring her forward and have her stand before יהוה.

5:17The priest shall take sacral water in an earthen vessel and, taking some of the earth that is on the floor of the Tabernacle, the priest shall put it into the water.

5:18After he has made the woman stand before יהוה, the priest shall bare the woman’s head and place upon her hands the meal offering of remembrance, which is a meal offering of jealousy. And in the priest’s hands shall be the water of bitterness that induces the spell.
1:3:5And she whose husband had intercourse with her on the journey. How does [the husband] deal with her? He brings her to the court in the place where he resides, and they assign to him two disciples of the sages lest he have intercourse with her on the journey. Rabbi Judah says, her husband is trusted with her. From the moment that she has been secluded with the man about whom she was warned, she and her husband are prohibited from having sexual relations. Just as adulterous women may not return to their husbands, so too suspected adulteresses may not. If he nevertheless has sexual relations with her on his way to the Temple to test her, he has committed a sin. The Talmud teaches that the Sotah ritual only works for a husband who is free from transgression. A husband who himself has transgressed the laws of forbidden sexual relations, may not bring his wife to test her. The mishnah is also stating that a husband cannot accuse his wife of being an adulteress and then keep living with her as usual. That would be hypocritical. This is a small measure of egalitarianism in Mishnah Sotah. We shall also see later the idea that just as the waters check her, they check him as well. The mishnah notes a problem. How can the husband accompany his wife on their way to Jerusalem to the Temple, without transgressing the prohibition? The fear is that while traveling and being secluded at night, the husband will have relations with her. The solution is that two disciples of the sages accompany them on their trip. Rabbi Judah holds that a husband is trusted not to have relations with his wife at times when she is prohibited to him.

English Explanation of Mishnah Sotah
1:6:4Whoever wishes to look upon her comes to look with the exception of her male and female slaves, since she has no shame in front of them. The mishnah allows, indeed encourages, the Sotah to be made into a public spectacle. Anyone who wishes to look at her can do so. The only exceptions are her male and female slaves, for they are accustomed to seeing her at her most intimate moments. Seeing them might encourage her not to admit to her crime, and one of the goals of the ceremony is for her to crime.
What happens to the body of a woman that has cheated on her husband, and undergoes the Sotah process?
Numbers
5:20But if you have gone astray while living in your husband’s household and have defiled yourself, if any party other than your husband has had carnal relations with you”—
5:21here the priest shall administer the curse of adjuration to the woman, as the priest goes on to say to the woman—“may יהוה make you a curse and an imprecation among your people, as יהוה causes your thigh to sag and your belly to distend;
5:22may this water that induces the spell enter your body, causing the belly to distend and the thigh to sag.” And the woman shall say, “Amen, amen!”
5:23The priest shall put these curses down in writing and rub it off into the water of bitterness.
In what way is the Sotah process unjust?

Strange as it may sound, the point of the biblical reworking of the ordeal, according to Jacob Milgrom, is to improve women’s lives. Just as Milgrom has read Bible in its ancient setting—literary, legal, and social—so have I attempted to read Talmud. And it has yielded similar results: although Tractate Sotah seems sexist on the surface, a contextualized reading shows that the underlying intent of the rabbis is to erase the inequities of the ritual and thereby diminish, although not eradicate, its patriarchy.
In what way does the Talmud understand the Sotah process different than the original Biblical text in Numbers?
Does not really answer this question - brings seemingly unrelated references

33We now understand why the Talmud, after quoting Ben Zoma's benediction, continues to quote Ben Zoma describe the tremendous physical difficulties encountered by Adam before he was able to eat the first loaf of bread. The Talmud details 10 stages, commencing with plowing, seeding, harvesting, etc. etc. Ben Zoma contrasts this with his own lifestyle. He gets up early in the morning and finds all his physical needs provided for. The Talmud continues in the same vein by describing the many steps needed before clothing is made, whereas Ben Zoma finds garments practically ready to wear. The gist of all this is to illustrate that Torah (Proverbs 3,18) is indeed עץ חיים היא למחזיקים בה, "the tree of life for all those who strengthen it and hold on to it." Midrash Tanchuma points out that Solomon did not say that Torah is a tree of life for those who toil with it, but only "for those who cleave to it." When Moses blessed the tribes prior to his death, he said to Zevulun and Issachar (33,18): "Rejoice Zevulun when you go out, and Issachar in your tent." Issachar can remain in his tent, isolated from the problems of earning a livelihood far from home because his brother Zevulun shoulders that particular burden on his behalf. When Ben Zoma recited the benediction in which he acknowledged G–d's being privy to all our secrets, i.e. being חכם הרזים, he alluded to the fact that only He knows which of the commandments we have not fulfilled because we were unable to for one reason or another. Only G–d knows which ones we compensated for through exhaustive study of their meaning instead.
I would like to do further study on the Sotah process, can you tell me which tractate describes her being brought to the temple?
It is not a chat bot and therefore cannot answer this question but brings sources that potentially relate 
Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, 1 Sotah
54Was this ritual ever carried out? Need one take this line of the Mishnah at face value? There is no obvious answer. Only one mention is made in rabbinic literature of the actual subjection of a woman to this ordeal (Mishnah Eduyot 5:6; PT Sotah 2:5; 18b). We read, however, in Mishnah Yoma 3:10, that Helene, the queen of Adiabene who converted to Judaism in the time of the Second Temple, made several generous donations to the Temple, among them a golden tablet on which were inscribed the verses of Sotah. The purpose of this tablet, presumably, was to make it easier for the kohanim to prepare the Sotah’s scroll. I find it ironic, and a bit too didactic, that a woman would make a gift to the Temple to be used to test women for sin.
